    <p align="justify">I’m a web designer and developer that tries to help other people get better at those things.

        I’m the co-founder of CodePen, a social development environment for web designers and developers. 
        CodePen is a front-end focused IDE in the browser allowing people to write HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and related languages. 
        It’s as much of a community and social network as a coding platform.
        Along with Dave Rupert, I’m the co-host of a podcast called ShopTalk, a show about (you guessed it) building websites. We’re over 10 years and 500 episodes strong!
        I built CSS-Tricks, a website all about building websites, and ran it for 15 years, from 2007 to 2022, before selling it to DigitalOcean.
        I’m big on the power of writing as a way to improve yourself and be successful.</p>
